Hi there! I'm tallyBot here to help you out with the numbers.

Below are few of the commands you can use:

`!start` : To check if I'm still up
`!help` : To get this

`!Ddata` : Gives the district-wise tally
`!Sdata` : Gives the state-wise tally

`!FS stateName` : Get the values of a specific state
`!FD districtName` : Get the values of a specific district

`!SD stateName` : Get the values of all districts in a state

`!distnatot` : Get the total DIST_NA
`!Sdistna stateName` : Get the DIST_NA for a state

`!Tdata` : Get today's updates, district-wise
`!TS`: Get today's updates, state-wise
`!FTS stateName` : Get today's updates for a given state
`!FTD districtName` : Get today's updates for a given district

`!Ydata` : Get yesterday's updates, district-wise
`!YS`: Get yesterday's updates, state-wise
`!FYS stateName` : Get yesterday's updates for a given state
`!FYD districtName` : Get yesterday's updates for a given district

For the latest sheet, add a 2 before the command.
Eg : `!2distnatot` for total DIST_NA in new sheet
